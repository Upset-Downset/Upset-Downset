# UpDown
The game of up-down

Authors: Charles Petersen and Jamison Barsotti

Up-down is a combinatorial game, much like NIM or Chomp. It's a bit more complicated but whatever.

Goal: create a playable version of up-down and an ai agent that learns to play it well, based on principals of reinforment learning.

upDown.py contains lots of crap.

HarrryPlotter.py contains functions that plot the game using matplotlib.pyplot.

upDownGame.py will execute a random game through the command line.
