# UpDown

Authors: Charles Petersen and Jamison Barsotti

Upset-downset is a two player game created by Tim Hsu in which the players alternate turns 
deleting nodes from graphs whose vertices are colored blue, green or red. The Up player moves 
by deleting a blue or green node, together with any nodes connected to it by a path moving 
strictly upward. (All nodes above the chosen node are removed regardless of their color.) Similarly, 
the Down player moves by deleting a red or green node, together with any nodes connected to it 
by a path moving strictly downward. (All nodes below the chosen node are removed regardless of 
their color.)  Eventually one of the players will find they cannot move because there are no longer
any nodes of their color. Whoever is first to find themselves in this predicament loses.  

Goal: develop and train an machine learning system that learns to play upset-downset well, based on the principals of reinforcement learning.
