# UpDown

Authors: Charles Petersen and Jamison Barsotti

The game of upset-downset:

Let P be a finite poset with coloring c:P -> {-1,0,1} where 1 (resp. 0,-1) 
represent blue (resp. green, red). The upset-downset game on P is the 
partizan combinatorial game with the following possible moves: For any element x in P colored blue or green, Left (Up) may remove the upset >x of x (all elements of P which are greater than or equal to x) leaving the colored poset P - >x, and for x in P colored red or green, Right (Down) may remove the downset <x of x (all elements of P which are less than or equal to x) leaving the colored poset P - <x. The first player unable to move loses.  

Goals: develop and train an AI system that learns to play upset-downset well, based on the principals of reinforment learning.
