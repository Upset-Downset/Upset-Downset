# UpDown
The game of up-down

Authors: Charles Petersen and Jamison Barsotti

Up-down is a combinatorial game, much like NIM or Chomp. It's a bit more complicated but whatever.

Goal: create a playable version of up-down and creat an ai agent that learns to play it well, based on principals of reinforment learning.
